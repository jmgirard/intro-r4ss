    "text": "A two-day workshop spanning basic programming, data wrangling, and modeling in R. Developed by Jeffrey Girard for the Pittsburgh Summer Methodology Series (June 1−2, 2023).\nR is a popular software option for analyzing, wrangling, and visualizing data in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. It is completely free, runs on all major platforms (i.e., Windows, Mac, and Linux), and offers a rich catalog of tools and techniques that are updated frequently. It is an excellent choice for a first programming language (when taught properly) and provides all the computational tools that most social scientists will ever need.\nThe main hurdle for many social scientists learning R is that it is largely controlled using “syntax” (i.e., computer code) rather than point-and-click menus. This characteristic is actually one of R’s greatest strengths, but can be intimidating to many without a background in computing. This two-day workshop is designed to ease the transition into using R. It aims to provide a solid foundation of conceptual knowledge and applied skills that build the confidence, curiosity, and motivation that will be required to continue learning and using R after the workshop ends.\nThe workshop assumes that attendees have no prior knowledge of or experience with R. It will discuss how to implement basic statistical techniques (e.g., correlations, t-tests, ANOVAs, and regression) in R. This part of the workshop could be a nice preview to these techniques for attendees unfamiliar with them but is meant more for those already familiar with their underlying theory (perhaps having learned about them in other software)."

    "section": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "text": "Frequently Asked Questions\n\nWhy enroll in this workshop?\nWhile there are many great educational resources for learning R, including some free video courses and textbooks, this workshop will provide a structured, guided, and communal environment that is tailor-built for researchers in the social, behavioral, and medical sciences. Thus, it emphasizes the concepts and skills most needed by such researchers. In particular, it teaches modern data science techniques using tools from the tidyverse ecosystem (e.g., the dplyr, tidyr, and ggplot2 packages) and statistical techniques using tools from the easystats ecosystem (e.g., the parameters, performance, modelbased, and see packages). The beauty of these tools is that they are both beginner-friendly and scalable to solve more complex problems and interface with more advanced techniques.\n\n\nWill this workshop cover extensions of the ANOVA framework?\nThis workshop will cover how to implement one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) to compare the means of multiple groups, as well as how to implement post-hoc pairwise t-tests to probe significant ANOVAs. However, this workshop will not cover the theory of these techniques or how to implement extensions of the ANOVA framework, such as factorial ANOVA, ANCOVA, MANCOVA, or repeated measures ANCOVA. These omissions are partly due to time constraints but also due to the instructor believing that the questions answered by these extensions are almost always better answered using linear regression and its extensions such as MLM and SEM. This workshop will show how to use linear regression to answer the questions answered by one-way and factorial ANOVA as well as ANCOVA. The Intermediate R for Social Scientists workshop will show how to use MLM to answer the questions answered by repeated measures ANCOVA, and other workshops will show how to use SEM to answer the questions answered by MANCOVA.\n\n\nWill this workshop cover non-parametric or Bayesian tests?\nR offers many great tools for non-parametric hypothesis testing and Bayesian estimation. This workshop will briefly mention non-parametric alternatives to the Pearson correlation and non-parametric tests for comparing two or more group means (and show how to implement them in R). However, this topic goes beyond the scope of an introductory workshop and will not be covered in great detail. Similarly, although the instructor makes extensive use of Bayesian estimation in his own work, this topic will not be covered here."
