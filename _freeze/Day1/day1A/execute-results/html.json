The latter will cover objects, naming, and functions.\n\n## Slides\n\n<iframe class=\"slide-deck\" src=\"./Slides/1A_Slides.html\" title=\"Day 1A Slideshow\">\n</iframe>\n\n[Click here to view the slides in their own window.](./Slides/01A_Slides.html)\n\n## Practice\n\n### Question 1.\n\nRead what the user wanted to do and look at the command they sent to R. Fix the errors in the commands and calculate the answers.\n\na)  I want to add 20 and 0.2 and divide that sum by 4.1. But I get an error when I try:<br />`[20 + .2] \\ 4.1`\nb)  I want to multiply 6 by the sum of 2 and 1,300. But I get an error when I try:<br />`6 x (2 + 1,300)`\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n**Answer (a)**\n\nChange the brackets `[]` to parentheses `()` because parentheses `()` are the order of operations operator in R. Also, change the backslash `\\` to a forward slash `/` because forward slash `/` is the division operator in R.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n(20 + .2) / 4.1\n#> [1] 4.926829\n```\n:::\n\n\n**Answer (b)**\n\nChange the `x` to an asterisk `*` because asterisk `*` is the multiplication operator in R. Also, remove the comma `,` from `1,300` because R doesn't use commas to delimit digits in large numbers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n6 * (2 + 1300)\n#> [1] 7812\n```\n:::\n\n\n</blockquote></details></p>\n\n---\n\n### Question 2\n\nWhich of the following commands do you think will create an error in R? Why?\n\na) `score@T1 <- 3.2`\nb) `score_at_T1 <- 3.2`\nc) `score at T1 <- 3.2`\nd) `1_score <- 3.2`\ne) `ScoreAtTime1 <- 3.2`\n\nMake your best guesses just by looking at the commands and then check your guesses by running the commands in R.\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n\n> The following commands will create an error in R: **a** (`@` is not allowed in an object name), **c** (spaces are not allowed in an object name), and **d** (the first character in an object name cannot be a number).\n\n</details></p>\n\n---\n\n### Question 3\n\na) Use the `cos()` function to calculate the cosine of 3 and assign it to a variable called `y`. Print the value of `y` to the console. \nb) Use a function to round `y` to the nearest whole number.\nc) Use a function to round `y` to two decimal places.\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Part (a)\ny <- cos(3)\ny\n## [1] -0.9899925\n\n# Part (b)\nround(y)\n## [1] -1\n\n# Part (c)\nround(y, digits = 2)\n## [1] -0.99\n```\n:::\n\n\n</blockquote></details></p>\n\n---\n\n### Question 4\n\nWhat do you expect the result to be for the following commands?\n\na) `sqrt(4 + 5)`\nb) `sqrt(4) + 5`\n\nMake your best guesses just by looking at the commands and then check your guesses by running the commands in R.\n\n<p><details>\n<summary>Click here for the answer key</summary>\n<blockquote>\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Part (a): Add then square root, same as sqrt(9)\nsqrt(4 + 5)\n## [1] 3\n\n# Part (b): Square root then add, same as 2 + 5\nsqrt(4) + 5 \n## [1] 7\n```\n:::\n\n\n</blockquote></details></p>\n\n## Readings\n\n  -   [\"Chapter 3: Workflow - Basics\"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-basics.html) from R4DS (2E)\n  -   [\"Chapter 7: Workflow - Scripts and Projects\"](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/workflow-scripts.html) from R4DS (2E)\n\n## Fun Stuff\n\n\"The Literal Genie\" - What it feels like to talk to R sometimes\n\n\n{{< video https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/58l7ZqoU0a0 >}}\n\n",
